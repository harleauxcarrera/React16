Lecture 62

  Dynamic styling through Conditionally changing the 'style' const inside if statement where persons are showing. (set default color of button to green)

Lecture 63 Dynamically adding classNames

Lecture 64 Adding and using Radium to be able to use inline styles with pseudo selectors and media queries
  npm install radium

  make sure to wrap the App component with radium

  Code:
    export default Radium(App); //radium called a higher-order component

  import radium and now you can use pseudo selectors like '':hover' in the inline styling constant

  in order to use media queries as inline styles, you must import a Component called StyleRoot from radium
  and wrap the retured dive in app.js in a StyleRoot component

  Code:

    import Radium, {StleRoot} from 'radium';

    return(
      <StyleRoot>
        <div>
            /.../
        </div>
      </StyleRoot>
    )
