Lecture 50 Rendering Content Conditionally

  Made button's onClick method trigger a method to toggle (hide/show) a certain div
    the div is wrapped in {} and this.state.showPersons ? <div>...</div>
        is added to check if original value of showPersons is true, if not true
        before ending bracket write " : null "

        Code:

        toggleDivHandler = () => {
          const doesShow = this.state.showPersons (originaly == false)
          this.setState({showPersons: !doesShow})
        }

    An alternative to using the ternary expression statement used above,
    we can create a constant variable , say, "persons" = null and right after the render() method call
    write if(this.state.showPersons){
      persons = <div>...</div>
    }
    This way keeps the return() call a lot cleaner.
